Field groups, meta boxes and a developer-friendly field API: 50 field types, repeaters, options pages, blocks and public forms.

== Description ==

MetaFields adds custom fields to posts, pages, custom post types, terms, users, comments, options pages and public forms. Build a field group in the admin, choose where it appears, and read the values back with one function.

**Fifty field types**, grouped by what they do rather than by name: text, number, email, URL, password, range, colour, date, time, phone, slug, UUID, currency, textarea, select, checkbox, radio, toggle, button group, rating, country, region, file, image, gallery, video, audio, post object, page link, relationship, taxonomy, user, link, rich text, code, JSON, HTML, repeater, flexible content, message, tab, accordion, group, icon picker, map, signature, QR code, barcode, embed and address.

**Where a group appears is a rule, not code.** Twenty-five location parameters cover post type, template, status, format, category, taxonomy, a specific post or page, page type and parent, the current user, user role and profile form, terms, attachments, comments, menus, menu items, widgets, blocks, options pages, and WooCommerce product types and order statuses.

**Values live in native WordPress storage.** A field on a post is post meta; a field on a term is term meta; an options page writes prefixed options. Nothing is kept in a custom table, so every value stays readable with `get_post_meta()` and reaches the REST API, exports and migrations like any other metadata.

= For developers =

    wpcmb_the_field( 'subtitle' );                          // escaped output
    $value = wpcmb_get_field( 'subtitle', $post_id );       // the stored value
    $all   = wpcmb_get_fields( 'options_site-settings' );   // a whole options page

Field groups can be registered in PHP with `wpcmb_register_field_group()` and kept in version control, exported as JSON or PHP from the Tools screen, and extended with your own field types through `wpcmb/register_field_types`. Validation, conditional logic, sanitizing and the save path are shared by every type, including your own.

= Required fields are enforced =

A required field stops a post or page reaching a public status — from either editor, from Quick Edit and from Bulk Edit. The browser holds the Publish button while a field is invalid, and the server refuses the status change if the browser is bypassed. An already-published post is never unpublished over a validation error; the problem is reported instead.

= Options pages =

Set a group's location to an options page and the screen is created, rendered and saved for you. No `add_menu_page`, no render callback, nothing in the theme.

= Public forms =

    [wpcmb_form group="group_abc123"]                 signed-in visitors
    [wpcmb_form group="group_abc123" guests="1"]      anyone

Submissions are stored in their own custom post type per group, with the values shown on the submission screen. The form's configuration travels signed with the site's own salts, so a visitor cannot edit the markup to change what a submission does.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install it from the Plugins screen.
2. Activate it.
3. Open **Meta Boxes → Field Groups** and add a group.
4. Add fields, choose where the group appears, and publish it.

No configuration is required.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the values stored? =

In WordPress's own tables. A field on a post is post meta under the field's own name, so `get_post_meta( $id, 'subtitle', true )` works whether or not this plugin is active. Term, user and comment fields use their own meta tables; options pages use options named `wpcmb_{page}_{field}`.

= What happens to my data if I deactivate the plugin? =

Nothing. Values stay where they are, and the template functions are the only thing that stops working. Deleting the plugin leaves the data too, unless you opt in under **Meta Boxes → Settings**.

= Can I define field groups in code? =

Yes. Export a group as PHP from the Tools screen, drop it into your theme or a plugin, and it is registered without touching the database. A stored group with the same key takes precedence, so you can export to code and carry on editing in the admin.

= Does it work with the block editor? =

Yes, in both editors. A group can also be registered as a block, in which case its fields are edited in the block sidebar and the values live in the block's attributes.

= Can visitors submit a form without an account? =

Only if you ask for it. `guests="1"` on the shortcode accepts submissions from anyone; without it a visitor is asked to sign in. Uploads always need an account.

= Is it translation ready? =

Yes. Every string is translatable under the `metafields-custom-fields` text domain, and the layout uses logical CSS properties so right-to-left needs no second stylesheet.

== Screenshots ==

1. The field group editor: fields, their settings, and the rules that decide where the group appears.
2. Fields on a post, in the block editor.
3. An options page, created from a location rule.
4. A repeater, with rows that reorder, duplicate and import from CSV.
5. The field group list, with each group's key, field count and location.

== Changelog ==

= 1.7.0 =
* Renamed to MetaFields - Custom Fields for WordPress, under the slug `metafields-custom-fields`.
* The text domain is now `metafields-custom-fields`. Translations against the old domain will need regenerating; stored field groups, values and settings are untouched.
* Added readme.txt and the full GPLv2 licence text.
* Added the Plugin Directory submission checks, and a build that refuses to package anything they reject.

= 1.6.0 =
* Required fields now stop a publish from Quick Edit and Bulk Edit, not only from the editors.
* A list table that refuses to publish something now says why.
* Fixed: an options page kept showing a failed save's errors to whoever opened it next, for five minutes, with no notice to explain them.
* Fixed: refreshing a failed options save reported that it had succeeded.

= 1.5.0 =
* Form submissions are stored in their own post type per field group, with the values readable on the submission screen.
* Fixed: the `comment` location rule matched post screens and never comment screens.
* Fixed: a location rule could be saved with no value while the screen showed one, so the group appeared nowhere.
* The field row controls in the group editor are drawn as icons rather than text glyphs.

= 1.4.0 =
* Fixed: the form shortcode could not store anything with its default settings.
* Fixed: repeaters did nothing on a public form — the script was never loaded, and its rows could not be fetched without an editing account.
* The group editor now offers both form shortcodes and says which is which.

= 1.3.0 =
* Options pages are created automatically from the location rules that name them.

= 1.2.0 =
* Required fields block a publish, in both editors and on the server.
* Validation reaches sub fields inside repeaters, groups and flexible content layouts.

= 1.1.0 =
* Modernised admin and field styling, dark mode, and a searchable multiple select.
* Hardened the AJAX endpoints, term capabilities and field name handling.

= 1.0.0 =
* First release.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.5.0 =
A field name beginning with an underscore is now stored without it. If you have one, rename the field or migrate its meta key before upgrading.
